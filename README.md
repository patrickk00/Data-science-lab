# Time series analysis project

The proposed project entails a thorough examination of sales trends across six restaurants in the
Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna regions, covering the period from September 2018 to April 2023.
Our objectives are threefold: first, to discern significant patterns in historical sales data; second,
to calculate the financial impact of closures due to the pandemic; and third, to predict future
performance for these establishments. The project begins with an exploratory analysis of the
collected historical sales figures from the selected restaurants. The purpose of this phase is to
detect and interpret various patterns, including seasonal variances and general trends across the
establishments. Subsequently, we will utilize a suite of models to rigorously analyze time series data,
which will also include an assessment of potential losses stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lastly, these models have been applied to estimate the future sales for the year 2023, for which
data is presently unavailable.
